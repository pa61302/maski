This is a simple web interface for a user to report (or reserve) a stay in a location and a timeframe (per day).

Initially this program was used to check who were in the same place at the same time in the event of COVID-19 exposrure.
The user can check, who else is present in order to avoid others.
All data is logged (and open for everyone to see).

The program written is in php and HTML and should work with any browser and operating system on client side.
PHP7 and a web server are required.
